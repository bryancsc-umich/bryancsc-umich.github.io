                        Contracts are usually a lengthy annoying part of life. We usually communicate contracts using lengthy email threads and it's annoying to sign them.
                        Plus, many of us would draft simple contracts during our everyday lives (such as sublease agreements and freelance work) but many of us aren't experienced in drafting contracts.

                        Play around with the existing open source chatbot creation platforms and you will realize that
                        many platforms place their focus on identifying a user intents. However, they aren't exactly 
                        well-designed when it comes to defining a "user path".

                        However, a user path is usually what we need when it comes to structured data collection. Sometimes what we need is a blend between old-fashion logic and neural-network based entity extraction.
                        
                        This dialogue management system does exactly that. It allows you to define a specific user path the old-fashioned way while also exposing intent and entity extraction for your use.
